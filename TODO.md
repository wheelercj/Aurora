# TODO

* in the generated HTML, use regex to give single-line code blocks a class and multiline code blocks a different class, and then have different CSS for them
* automatically remove unused images from the site's images folder
* code block syntax highlighting (with https://pygments.org/docs/quickstart/ and/or https://gist.github.com/Ibrahim-Islam/0661f4e60d5d5c81e22f ?)
* Change the internal links from section symbol to note title. Keep a section symbol in front?
* Check for link rot
* add a search feature to index.html. Make it work with tags too.
* website breadcrumbs
