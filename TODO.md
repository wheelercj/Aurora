# TODO

* Change the internal links from section symbol to note title. Keep a section symbol in front?
* Create another script to check for link rot, especially for internal links. List all zettels on index.md?
* The only thing that should affect code blocks and HTML comments throughout the entire program is the conversion from markdown to HTML. Prevent searching for attachment links in those. Is my current approach of temporarily removing code blocks the best choice?
* Try gh_md_to_html's option that runs offline and doesn't add CSS: `html_as_a_string = gh_md_to_html.core_converter.markdown(your_markdown_as_a_string)`. If this doesn't work well, write a function that copies my own github-css.css to the folder github-markdown-css. Copy the ideal CSS that should be in the file auto-generated by gh_md_to_html, put that in a new CSS file, and write a function that copies that style too (after gh_md_to_html runs). Then remove the function that removes the divs and article from all the HTML files.

## long-term
* make this work with command-line arguments?
* Add a license. Figure out which licenses I'm allowed to consider using. gh-md-to-html uses the MIT license.
* type hinting
* docstrings
* more options moved to generate_my_site.py
* allow posts to be in a different folder from index.html, etc.
* add a search feature to index.html. Make it work with tags too.
* breadcrumbs
