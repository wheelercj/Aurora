* code block syntax highlighting (with https://pygments.org/docs/quickstart/ and/or https://gist.github.com/Ibrahim-Islam/0661f4e60d5d5c81e22f ?)
* automatically remove unused images from the site's images folder
* Change the internal links from section symbol to note title. Keep a section symbol in front?
* Check for external link rot
