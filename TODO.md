# TODO

* change the internal links from section symbol to note title. keep a section symbol in front?
* create a function that checks whether the output of gh_md_to_html is the REST API error message. warn the user if site generation failed.
* create another script to check for link rot, especially for internal links. list all zettels on index.md.

## if more speed is needed
* figure out how to increase my REST API access?
* Try gh_md_to_html's option that runs offline and doesn't add CSS: `html_as_a_string = gh_md_to_html.core_converter.markdown(your_markdown_as_a_string)`. If this doesn't work well, write a function that copies my own github-css.css to the folder github-markdown-css. Copy the ideal CSS that should be in the file auto-generated by gh_md_to_html, put that in a new CSS file, and write a function that copies that style too (after gh_md_to_html runs). Then remove the function that removes the divs and article from all the HTML files.

## long-term
* make this work with command-line arguments?
* Add a license. Figure out which licenses I'm allowed to consider using. gh-md-to-html uses the MIT license.
* type hinting
* docstrings
* more options moved to generate_my_site.py
* allow posts to be in a different folder from index.html, etc.
