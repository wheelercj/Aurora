# zk-ssg

This is a static site generator (SSG) for [zettelkastens](https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/), which means it converts markdown-based zettelkastens into fully functional HTML and CSS files that can be immediately published as a website. Most of the files in the site folder get overwritten each time this program runs (details below). This program **_never_** makes any changes to the files in the zettelkasten; it only copies the relevant files to the site folder and works with those copies. It is 100% compatible with [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)'s default settings for internal links and file names. Feature requests, contributions, etc. are welcome!

After setting up once (explained below), you can add more HTML pages to your website folder by simply adding the `#published` tag to markdown files in your zettelkasten and running this program again.

[Here's a site that was built with this program.](https://wheelercj.github.io/notes/)

## Setup
1. Create a new folder that will hold your website's files.
2. In your zettelkasten folder, create `index.md` and `about.md`. `index.md` will later become your site's homepage, and has special options explained in the next steps. You can write whatever you would like in `about.md`.
3. In your zettelkasten folder, add the `#published` tag to each markdown file that you want to publish, including `index.md` and `about.md`. Only files with this tag will be copied to the site folder.
4. In `index.md`, add other tags for the categories of zettels you want links to be listed for. When zk-ssg makes a copy of `index.md`, in that copy, it will automatically replace each of the tags (except `#published`) with links to zettels that also have that same tag. Any headers, empty lines, etc. you added to the file around the tags will be kept, so you will probably want to spread the tags out. [Here's](https://gist.github.com/wheelercj/f5a974277f2d6096471a88a2c27562f0) an example of how you can write `index.md`.
5. In `generate_site.py`, near the top of the file are some variables you will want to customize. Their defaults are what I use for my site:
```python
zettelkasten_path = 'C:/Users/chris/Documents/zettelkasten'
site_path = 'C:/Users/chris/Documents/site'
site_title = "Chris' notes"
copyright_text = 'Â© 2021 Chris Wheeler'
```
6. You might also want to customize `style.css`, such as to change the site's colors.
7. Run this program. Now you're ready to send your new HTML files to your site's host! If you don't have one yet, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is worth considering.

## Current limitations
* You can only choose one folder for the program to copy files from.
* The only markdown files you can publish that have alphabetic characters in their file names are `index.md` and `about.md`. The names of all the other markdown files you want to publish must be 14-digit numbers followed by `.md`, e.g. `20201221140928.md`. The number represents the time of the file's creation in the YYYYMMDDhhmmss format.
* Internal links are double square brackets surrounding a 14-digit number, followed by the file's title (its first header), e.g. `[[20201221140928]] this is the title`. The link's 14-digit number is the same as the linked file's name.

## What gets overwritten or deleted?
### Short answer
* **_Nothing_** in the zettelkasten folder is changed in any way.
* Site files with the same name as zettelkasten files get overwritten.
* All markdown files in the site folder's posts folder that do not get overwritten get deleted.
* The program will ask to delete HTML files that were not overwritten.
* Some markdown files in the site folder (outside the posts folder) may be overwritten, depending on their names.

### Detailed answer
When the site files are being generated, all currently existing markdown and HTML files in the site folder that happen to have the same name as any markdown files in the zettelkasten folder that contain the `#published` tag will be overwritten. The program will not overwrite `style.css` and will create it only if it does not already exist. Any markdown files in the site folder's posts folder that do not get overwritten will be deleted. Specific markdown files in the site folder (outside the posts folder) will get overwritten: `index.md`, `about.md`, `alphabetical-index.md`, and `chronological-index.md`. If there are HTML files in the site folder that do not get overwritten, the program will ask to delete them unless their absolute paths are listed in a file in the site folder named `ssg-ignore.txt`, each file path on its own line.
